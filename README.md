# marketopy
Python 3 Project for Marketo REST API

## Prerequisites
If you would like to setup a configuration file instead of using command line arguements you can create a file labeled as `secrets.py` in the main folder to run as a tool locally. In this file the structure should follow:
```
SUBSCRIPTION_INFORMATION = [
    {
        "MUNCHKIN_ID": "",
        "CLIENT_ID": "",
        "CLIENT_SECRET": ""
    },
    {
        "MUNCHKIN_ID": "",
        "CLIENT_ID": "",
        "CLIENT_SECRET": ""
    }
]
```
